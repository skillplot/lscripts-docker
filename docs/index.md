# Lscripts Documentation

Welcome to **Lscripts** — a shell-first toolkit that helps you **bootstrap, govern, and ship** reproducible
developer + ML environments across laptops, workstations, and air‑gapped/HPC systems.

{: .prompt-info }
This documentation is organized as *chapters* (posts). Start with **Start Here** and follow the series, or use **Search**.

## Fast paths

- **Start Here** → what Lscripts is, what problems it solves, and the core mental model.
- **Install Guide** → workstation & HPC-friendly installation patterns.
- **Commands** → a searchable catalog of `lsd-*` modules and commands.
- **Offline Bundles** → air‑gapped export → verify → install.

## What you’ll find here

- A modern docs UX (dark mode, fast search, great typography)
- Design notes (why the system is structured the way it is)
- Practical recipes (copy/paste commands, verification, troubleshooting)
