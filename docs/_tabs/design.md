# System design

Lscripts is intentionally **modular**: each subsystem can be learned, tested, and replaced without rewriting everything.

## Design goals

- **Safety**: destructive actions require explicit confirmation.
- **Reproducibility**: envs can be pinned, replicated, and audited.
- **Portability**: workstation ↔ HPC ↔ air‑gapped.
- **Observability**: logs are first-class.

## Where to go next

- Read the **System Design** chapter (2026 series)
- Browse design notes (2016→2025) to understand the evolution
