# About Lscripts

Lscripts began as a set of pragmatic “glue scripts” for ML and systems work, and evolved into a **shell-first framework**
for building repeatable environments.

## Who is this for?

- Engineers who want **one command** to bootstrap a machine into a known-good state.
- ML practitioners who need **reproducible CUDA + Conda + Docker** without mystery.
- Teams shipping into **air‑gapped** environments.

## Author

**mangalbhaskar** — engineering notes and operational playbooks.
