# Documentation

This site is written as a **field manual**: short chapters, heavy on examples, and safe defaults.

## Start here

- **Start Here**: mental model, repo layout, and how to run things safely.
- **Install Guide**: workstation/HPC prerequisites.
- **System Design**: modules, boundaries, and conventions.
- **Operations & Validation**: what “done” looks like (health checks, integrity checks, and troubleshooting).

## Reading path

1. Start Here (2026 series)
2. Install Guide
3. Command Reference
4. Offline Bundles (air‑gapped)
5. Module deep dives (Docker, CUDA, Conda)

> Use Search (`/`) anytime — commands and modules are indexed.
